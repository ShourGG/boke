3. **Technical Lead Review**: Technical lead reviews for architecture compliance
4. **Approval**: Code approved for merge after all reviews pass

## 🔄 Change Management

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
All significant architectural decisions must be documented using ADR format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the situation and problem]

## Decision
[Describe the decision and rationale]

## Consequences
[Describe positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options and why they were rejected]
```

### Change Request Process

    A[Change Request] --> B{Impact Assessment}
    B -->|Low Impact| C[Technical Lead Approval]
    B -->|Medium Impact| D[Team Discussion]
    B -->|High Impact| E[Stakeholder Review]
    
    C --> F[Implementation]
    D --> G{Consensus?}
    E --> H{Approved?}

    H -->|Yes| F
    H -->|No| J[Reject Change]
    
    I --> B
    F --> K[Documentation Update]
    K --> L[Communication]
```

### Impact Assessment Criteria
- **Low Impact**: Bug fixes, minor improvements, documentation updates
- **Medium Impact**: New features, dependency updates, performance optimizations
- **High Impact**: Architecture changes, security modifications, major refactoring

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Quality Gates
Each phase has specific quality gates that must be passed:

- [ ] Performance tests meet targets
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Browser compatibility verified

#### Deployment Phase
